# 🧩 TaskTalk — Full Stack App (Flask + React)

A simple full-stack project built as part of the **Associate Software Engineer (Python/React)** internship at **Better** (via Internshala).  
This app allows users to add, view, and manage comments under a single task — demonstrating both **backend (Python Flask)** and **frontend (React)** integration.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Create and view comments dynamically.
- Live connection between Flask (backend) and React (frontend).
- REST API built with Flask and SQLAlchemy (using SQLite database).
- React frontend built with Axios for API calls.
- Simple, clean, and easy-to-explain UI.
